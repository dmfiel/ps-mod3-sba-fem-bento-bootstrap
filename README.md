## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Frontend toolkit

### What I learned

It was quite difficult to achieve matching styling with Bootstrap, since its options need to be customized with Sass, which we don't have installed yet. So many of the tweaks needed to be done with CSS and media queries. But, in the end, we were able to use much of the functionaly of bootstrap to implement this design.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - This design has a very complex grid layout, which was beyond the usual capabilities of Bootstrap, so I instead used a 4x10 CSS grid layout, which worked perfectly.
