Reflection Questions

1. Challenges you encountered during the project.

After using Tailwind, it was easy to tweak with custom sizes and colors. Unfortunately, this is not possible in Bootstrap without using Sass. The installation of Sass took a while, but I was eventually able to get the Sass compiler running. However, the compiled CSS didn't seem to change the styling of my web page. This was likely due to improper formatting of the SCSS and/or a problem including the CSS on my page.

The Bootstrap grid tool wasn't well suited to this design. I was able to get the grid layout working with four nested Bootstrap grids, but the resulting HTML was very confounded and unwieldy.

2. Your approach to solving these challenges.

Instead of using Sass, I instead used inline styles along with a separate CSS file including media queries. Instead of using the Bootstrap grid, I used a custom CSS grid layout generated by a tool. This worked very well, especially combined with the responsive vertical layout.

3. Improvements you would make if given more time.

Given more time, I would get Sass working in order to utilize Bootstrap more fully and hopefully eliminate most, if not all, inline styling and separate CSS. Also, I would explore the Bootstrap grid capabilities further.
